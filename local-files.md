# Playing Local Files

HISPlayer Windows for Unreal can play local content using the absolute path. For example : **C:/yourVideo.mp4** . 

Select the **HISPlayer_Blueprint** in the level outliner, go to the **Details** window and inside the **HISPlayer** section you can find the variable **Stream URL** that you will be able to customize. Please input the absolute path where the video file is located into the **Stream URL** field.
